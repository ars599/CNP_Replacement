# Purpose: To replace the fields and convert to the reference grid
# History: 24/03/2023 v1
# -------------------------------------
# Note:
#       You can find how to run this script in the comments. At the moment, 
#   it can only handle single level and pseudo level fields. It cannot be 
#   used to replace model level fields. If you need to do so, we can add more functions to it later.
#       I am now using scipy.interpolate.RegularGridInterpolator to regrid the field. 
#   However the results are different from those using cdo. So please check again to see 
#   if you can use /g/data/p66/lz3062/replace_dumpfile/replace_fields/bi889a.da10500101_00_modified
#   to run the experiments.
#       Here we test the LAI, and other CNP related fields for CAABLE initial to use.
#   Those fields in bi889a.da10500101_00 were wrong so that need to be replaced from ESM1.5 start dump.
